# CorruptedResources - BEDROCK TEST PORT
## The resource pack for TheCorruptedGhosty
### This resource pack is an extremely primitave port to Bedrock Edition. The main version of the resource pack for Java can be found [here](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/corruptedresources/tree/main).
Special thanks to [@ShoomyD](https://github.com/ShroomyD) for the enbee textures!

### Install Instructions
#### These instructions are intended for Bedrock.  If you are running Java Edition, refer to the [Java Edition of the resource pack](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/corruptedresources/tree/main)
Install the resource pack like any other resource pack. You can find the download at [the Bedrock Releases page](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/corruptedresources/releases/tag/bedrock). You may have to click on "Assets" to find the download. Refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/ghostypack/blob/TEST_bedrock/install.md) for help adding the pack to Minecraft.

Note: The current state of Bedrock doesn't have any CET (Custom Entity Texture) or CIT (Custom Item Textures) mods. This means the Enbee easter egg and connected wool textures will not work. If any of you know of a mod that adds this functionality, submit an issue report or pull request.
