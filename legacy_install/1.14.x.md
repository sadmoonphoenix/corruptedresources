# CorruptedResources
## The resource pack for TheCorruptedGhosty
### This resource pack requires some mods to work as intended. Read below. 
#### This resource pack is intended for Java Edition. Bedrock port may be coming soon. 
Special thanks to [@ShoomyD](https://github.com/ShroomyD) for the enbee textures!

\
If you encounter any missing textures or bugs, file an issue report on GitHub.
### Install Instructions
#### These instructions are intended for versions 1.14.x. If you are running a different version refer to [Legacy Installtion](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/corruptedresources/tree/main/legacy_install). If you are running the newest version of Minecraft, you should then refer to [Main Installion](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/corruptedresources/blob/main/README.md) instead. 
Install the resource pack like any other resource pack. You can find the download at [the Releases page](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/corruptedresources/releases). You may have to click on "Assets" to find the download. Refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/ghostypack/blob/main/install.md#how-to-install-a-minecraft-resourcepack) for help adding the pack to Minecraft.
\
\
As aforementioned, some mods are required for the resource pack to work as intended. 
\
\
[OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) supports both standalone and Forge. Refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/ghostypack/blob/main/install.md#how-to-install-optifine) for help.
\
Install OptiFine, and you're done!
\
\
If you want to use Fabric instead, some alternative mods are available. 
\
First, install the Fabric Mod Loader. [Need help?](https://github.com/sadmoonphoenix/ghostypack/blob/main/install.md#how-to-install-alternative-fabric-mods)
\
Then, install the following mods: (Previous help link also applies here)
\
\
[Colormatic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colormatic/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A64806) (download the latest avalible version for 1.14.x)
\
[Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A64806) (required to make the mods work. download the version that matches your Fabric version, most likely the latest available for 1.16.x)
\
\
Note 1: This version of Minecraft doesn't have bees. This means the Enbee easter egg will not work.
\
\
Note 2: If you intend on using Sodium alongside these mods, the game will probably crash unless you install [Indium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/indium/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A70886). Make sure the version of Indium matches with the version of Sodium you intend to use.
\
\
Note 3: There is no Connected Block Mods for Fabric 1.14, that I know of. Submit an issue/PR if you know of one. If you want the connected wool textures, you will have to use OptiFine.
